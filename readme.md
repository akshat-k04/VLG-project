# Image Denoising Project

## Introduction

This project aims to develop an image denoising model from scratch without using any pre-trained models. The final model's performance is evaluated based on Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the training dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
